// engine/aoxBest.ts — pure Best-record reconciliation for AoX (the component wrapper layer).
//
// AoX keeps a per-config Best Average / Best Median record — the FASTEST run a config has produced.
// "Best" here means MINIMUM time (lower is better), the opposite of Blitz's maximum score. A run records
// its Best on completion (the Nth credited solve); a post-completion Override that undoes that solve
// rolls the Best back. The record holds, for EACH of the two metrics, the metric value PLUS its
// companion stat (avgMed = the median of the run that set the best average; medAvg = the average of the
// run that set the best median) and the run id that set it — so the two metrics can come from DIFFERENT
// runs and each carries the matching stats from its own run.
//
// RECONCILE is continuous, like Blitz's. An ended run's history stays browsable and overridable, so
// a post-completion Override can retract one of the run's n credited solves (back-browse Path 1 /
// retro Path 5) or add a credit (crediting a miss) — the run's standing stats keep moving after the
// completion recorded the Best. So AoxMode snapshots the ENTIRE pre-run Best object when the run
// records (the cumulative best of every PRIOR run — the floor that can never be lost, the cross-run
// corner the Blitz C2 fix had to add) and, on every post-completion stats change, sets the record to
// reconcileAoxStanding(snapshot, standing stats): still standing (good ≥ n) → the snapshot improved
// by the run's CURRENT avg/median; no longer standing (a credit was retracted) → the snapshot
// unchanged, as if the run never completed. That subsumes the old undo-the-completing-solve rollback
// and closes the back-browse hole (before the fix, only the live-edge reversal rolled the Best back,
// so a back-browse un-credit left a FABRICATED Best standing on a run with fewer than n credits).
// Extracted from main.tsx so it can be fuzzed directly against an independent oracle (best == the
// min avg/median among standing runs). Pure — no React, no app state. Mirrors engine/blitzBest.ts.
// (C2 Part 1.)

// never silently beat the recorded Best. The moment it stops standing (good < n — a post-end
