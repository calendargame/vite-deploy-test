// Sums the gzipped size of the built app JS (dist/assets/*.js) and fails if it exceeds the
// budget below. This catches a surprise regression (e.g. importing a large library) before it
// ships. It is NOT a no-growth rule: when growth is intentional, bump BUDGET_TOTAL_JS_GZIP_KB
// deliberately — that one-line change is the conscious "yes, the app got bigger" decision, and
// shows up in the diff/PR. Dependency-free (Node's built-in zlib), so CI needs nothing extra.
//
// Why gzip level 9 + sum-of-files: GitHub Pages serves each asset compressed independently, so
// the realistic transfer cost is the sum of each file's own gzip. Level 9 = the smallest gzip
// (a stable, reproducible yardstick). The number won't match Vite's build log exactly (Vite
// reports its own gzip estimate) — that's fine; what matters is a consistent line in the sand.

// method). ~15 KB / ~12% headroom is deliberate: enough for normal iteration, tight enough to
