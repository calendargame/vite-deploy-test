// tests/engine/referenceModel.js — the fully-INDEPENDENT reference score model (C2 Part 3).
//
// A second, separately-written implementation of the game's SCORING CONTRACT that replays the same
// action stream as the reducer and computes the expected stats from its own per-question ledger —
// WITHOUT the reducer's stack/forwardStack, hasCredit flags, capsules, or snapshots. The fuzz
// (fuzzHarness.js, referenceModel profiles) compares the two after every action.
//
// WHY a second model when the strong oracle already cross-checks: the strong oracle reconstructs
// `good` from the reducer's own per-entry hasCredit flags — it catches aggregate-vs-flag DESYNCS
// (every bug so far) but would miss a state where the aggregate AND the flag are wrong TOGETHER
// (e.g. an override path crediting a question that semantically shouldn't credit, setting both).
// This model re-derives what SHOULD be credited from the user-visible rules alone, so that class
// disagrees here. It also asserts `played` — which no prior oracle checked at all.
//
// INDEPENDENCE BOUNDARY (designed, not accidental): the model consumes only DISPLAY facts —
// question identity, never scoring state:
//   • per ANSWER, `isCorrect` (does the clicked option match the on-screen question — date math,
//     separately proven by the date-gen fuzz + invariants);
//   • per advancing/reset/regen action, whether the question now on screen is a Deduction puzzle
//     (`nextDed` from the action's nextDate / `liveDedAfter` from the screen — which date survives
//     a Reset/regen is a VIEW rule about the displayed question, so the model reads the outcome
//     rather than re-deriving keep-vs-replace nuances).
//   • Everything else — per-question credit/burn/freeze state, the browse cursor, the override
//     target + effect, played/good/streak/best/times derivation — is modeled here from first
//     principles (the contract: How-to-Play + the characterization tests), sharing ZERO code with
//     the reducer (even the streak walk is re-implemented inline).
//
// THE MODEL: questions live in `history` (every question ADVANCED PAST that was scored, in order)
// plus the single `live` slot. Browsing is just a cursor (0 = the live edge; k = standing on
// history[length-k]) — entries never move (unlike the reducer's stack↔forwardStack shuffle).
// Stats are DERIVED, never maintained:
//   played = scored questions  ·  good = credited questions  ·  times = the credited solve times
//   best = the longest credit run in question order  ·  streak = the trailing run (clean edge only)
//
// Per-question scoring rules (the contract):
//   • A question is SCORED (counts a played) by its FIRST stat action — answer / Reveal / Show
//     Codes on the live question / per-question timeout — IF Save Stats was effectively on; that
//     first action FREEZES the question's Save-Stats (ssFrozen), so a later toggle can't re-score
//     or un-score it. One played per question, ever.
//   • It is CREDITED only by a clean first-try correct answer (never revealed/burned first), or by
//     an Override flip TO credited; an Override flip away removes the credit. One override per
//     question, ever (the driver's availability gate enforces reachability; the model asserts it).
//   • Its TIME contribution exists only while credited: a first-try correct contributes its solve
//     time (when timing is tracked); an override-credit contributes the time of the original wrong
//     answer (when tracked); un-crediting removes the contribution.
//   • Only SCORED questions enter history on advance (an unscored question vanishes — it was never
//     played); LOCK_REVEAL resolves a question without scoring it.
//   • Advancing past a scored BURNED non-puzzle question arms the retroactive credit (Path 4).
//
// OVERRIDE target selection mirrors the UI contract's priority (browse target → the held completing
// solve → the live burned question → the armed previous wrong → the most recent history entry); the
// EFFECTS are computed purely from the model's own ledger. Flip direction = the target's CURRENT
// credited state — equivalent to the reducer's snapshot.wasWrong on the reachable surface because a
// question can be overridden at most once.
